// Amazon Music is working on a new feature to pair songs together to
// play while on the bus. The goal of this feature is to select two songs
// Â©
// from a list that will end exactlv 30 seconds before the listener reaches
// their stop. You are tasked with writing the method that selects the
// songs from a list. Each song is assigned a unique ID, numbered from 0
// to N-1.

// Assumptions:
// 1. You will pick exactly two songs.
// 2. You cannot pick the same song twice.
// 3. If you have multiple pairs with the same total time, select the pair
// with the longest song.
// 4. There are at least two songs available.

// Write an algorithm to find the IDs of two songs whose combined
// runtime will finish exactly 30 seconds before the bus arrives,
// keeping the original order.
// Input
// The input to the function/method consists of two arguments-
// rideDuration, an integer representing the duration of the ride in
// seconds;
// songDurations, a list of integers representing the duration of the
// songs,
// Output
// Return a pair of integers representing the IDs of two songs whose
// combined runtime will finish exactly 30 seconds before the rider
// reaches their stop. If no such pair is possible, return a pair with <-1,
// -1>.
// Example
// Input;
// rideDuration = 90
// songDurations= [1, 10, 25, 35, 60]
// Output:
// [2, 3]
// Explanation:
// During the ride duration of 90 seconds, the rider listens to the third
// and fourth songs (2nd and 3rd index, respectively) which end exactly
// 30 seconds before the bus arrives at their stop.

// If two songs have the same duration, select the option with the lowest
// index,

const rDur1 = 90;
const sDurs1 = [1, 10, 25, 35, 60];
const exp1 = [2, 3];

const rDur2 = 120;
const sDurs2 = [50, 40, 80, 10, 20];
const exp2 = [2, 3];

const rDur3 = 100;
const sDurs3 = [40, 30, 20, 10, 40];
const exp3 = [0, 1];

function findSongs(rideDuration, songDurations) {

}
